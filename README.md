_bem
===

I'm a fork of [_s project](https://travis-ci.org/maliMirkec/_bem).

Just like `_s`, I'm a theme for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

**And to provide [`BEM`](https://en.bem.info/) structure [for most of Wordpress components](https://github.com/maliMirkec/_bem/blob/master/_bem.todo).**

Intro
--

I use `BEM` as a `CSS` methodology because `BEM` is easy to understand and easy to use. I know that `BEM` is not easy to implement, so please be kind if you find any inconsistencies and feel free to open [new issue](https://github.com/maliMirkec/_bem/issues/new).

Installation
--

If you want me to be your starter project, clone me into `./wp-content/themes/` folder. It is recommended to rename cloned folder to match new theme name. Also, try to find all occurrences of '_bem' in newly cloned folder and replace it with new theme name.

Theming

Important notes
--

This is work in progress. Default styling is not yet fully applied. `BEM` classes are not fully implemented.
